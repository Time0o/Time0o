## About Me

My name is Timo and I am a software engineer based in Zurich, Switzerland. Here's an overview of what I am good at and interested in:

* My languages of choice is usually C++, I am always trying to improve my understanding of new and obscure language features.
* I love all things system programing, particularly compilers and operating systems. I am interested in building systems that are performant and scalable.
* I hold a master's degree in information systems technology from TU Dresden.
* Nowadays I am also a part-time mathematics student, currently focussing on linear algebra and probability theory.
