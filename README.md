## Hello There

My name is Timo and I'm a software developer at Gapfruit, a Swiss startup where I work on the Gapfruit microkernel OS for secure IoT edge gateways. In my spare time I am crazy about all things system programing, currently particularly operating systems and compilers. I am also a part-time math student when time allows. You can find out more about me on my [website](https://Time0o.github.io).
